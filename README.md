**NHD Team Travel & Status Calendar**

A real-time, collaborative calendar designed to track the weekly and yearly status of team members across different departments.


**üìñ About The Project**

The NHD Travel Calendar is a web application built to provide a clear and immediate overview of where team members are located and what their work status is. It solves the logistical challenge of coordinating a team that may be working from different locations (in NEOM, remotely, or traveling for business).

Managers and team members can see at a glance who is available, on vacation, or on medical leave, making it easier to plan meetings and allocate resources. The application features both a detailed weekly view for short-term planning and a high-level yearly overview for long-term visibility.


**‚ú® Key Features**

Dual Calendar Views: Switch seamlessly between a detailed Weekly View and a high-level Yearly Overview.

Dynamic Client-Side Management: Easily add, rename, and delete departments and employees directly in the interface. All data is managed in the browser session.

Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Intuitively reorder employees within a department or move them between departments.

Comprehensive Status Tracking: Assign daily statuses to team members, including In NEOM, Vacation, Remote Work, Business Travel, and more.

Intuitive Navigation: Quickly navigate between weeks, months, and years to view past, present, and future schedules.

Frontend-Only Architecture: A lightweight, client-side application with no backend dependencies, making it simple to deploy.
