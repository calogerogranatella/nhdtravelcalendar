NHD Team Travel & Status Calendar
A real-time, collaborative calendar designed to track the weekly and yearly status of team members across different departments.

üìñ About The Project
The NHD Travel Calendar is a web application built to provide a clear and immediate overview of where team members are located and what their work status is. It solves the logistical challenge of coordinating a team that may be working from different locations (in NEOM, remotely, or traveling for business).

Managers and team members can see at a glance who is available, on vacation, or on medical leave, making it easier to plan meetings and allocate resources. The application features both a detailed weekly view for short-term planning and a high-level yearly overview for long-term visibility.
